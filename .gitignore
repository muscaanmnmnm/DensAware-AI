Ignore the virtual environment (heavy)

venv/
pycache/
*.pyc

Ignore the huge dataset images (Github limit is 100MB)

data/images/
data/processed_images/
*.png
*.jpg
*.jpeg

Ignore the trained model if it is >100MB (Optional, usually good to ignore)

*.pth
*.joblib

Ignore Mac/Windows system files

.DS_Store
Thumbs.db


### **Step 2: Initialize Git (Locally)**
1.  Open your **VS Code Terminal** (`Ctrl + ~`).
2.  Run these commands one by one:

```bash
# 1. Initialize the repository
git init

# 2. Add all files (The .gitignore will block the huge files automatically)
git add .

# 3. Commit the changes (Save the snapshot)
git commit -m "Final submission: Density-Aware Dual-Stream Architecture"


Step 3: Create the Repository on GitHub

Go to GitHub.com and log in.

Click the + icon in the top right -> New repository.

Repository name: Density-Aware-Mammography (or DensAware-AI).

Description: "Final Year Engineering Project: A Dual-Stream Multimodal Fusion Framework for Breast Cancer Detection."

Public/Private: Choose Public (so your professor can see it).

Do NOT check "Add a README" (you already have one).

Click Create repository.

Step 4: Connect and Push

GitHub will show you a page with commands. Copy the ones under "…or push an existing repository from the command line".

It will look like this (run these in your VS Code terminal):

# 1. Link your local folder to GitHub (Replace URL with YOUR specific link)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Density-Aware-Mammography.git

# 2. Rename branch to main (Standard practice)
git branch -M main

# 3. Push the code
git push -u origin main
